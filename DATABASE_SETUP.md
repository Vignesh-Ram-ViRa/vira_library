# AI Tools Library - Database Setup

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Account**: Make sure you have a Supabase project set up
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env` file has the correct Supabase credentials

## Step 1: Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Step 2: Run Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `utilities/database/ai-tools-schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

This will create:
- `ai_tool_categories` table with predefined categories
- `ai_tools` table for storing AI tools
- `ai_tool_ratings` table for user ratings
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Sample data including 10 AI tools

## Step 3: Create Demo User (Optional)

If you want to test with the demo user functionality:

1. Create a user account with email: `vickyram.vira@gmail.com`
2. This user will be used for guest access to sample data

## Step 4: Verify Setup

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the AI Tools page
3. You should see the sample AI tools loaded
4. Test filtering, searching, and view toggling
